# Description

This project is a landing page clone of the website <a href="https://www.git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a>
Only for training purposes with HTML and CSS

A simple landing page, just the initial page for training a responsive website in HTML and styling with CSS, using "Sublime Text 3" as a text editor.


The images and colors used were taken from the original website.

The "informacoes.html" file is a simple HTML that is not responsive and not very stylized, having only a demonstration of how the comparison between the original from Git and the clone created by me was. It also contains gifs with responsive templates in different screen sizes.

# Tests

Two chrome extensions were used for the tests:

<br><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk" target="_blank">Mobile simulator</a>
